# CG4Games

Created by Eric Ameres for my Computer Graphics for Games Students May 2021
Simple OpenGL applpication for sandboxing Graphics Algorithms

I created this file as a framework for experimenting with shaders and testing primitive graphics algorithms within OpenGL

To work with pixel by pixel algorithms, a small texture is used that is written into directly, but then used as a texture

using IMGUI the program also allows for "hot swapping" the basic vertex and fragment shaders
